# Gossip Protocol

## Immediate TODOS
* Add in any extra BAR Gossip specific from Tsiamfei's last pull request.
* Implement the Koorde Protocol as a distributed hash table to store peers and forward messages.
* Implement a form of long term storage for peers. Can be as simple as a LevelDB based off the new storage paradigm, or a memoryDB. Liscense if needed.
