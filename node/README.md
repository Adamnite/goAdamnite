# Directory for core node software
The core node software for Adamnite should be developed here. The node software should utilize the gossip protocol to exchange messages relevant to consensus, store transaction mempools (pending transactions), and run the Adamnite consensus protocol. 

The node directory should include an implementation of a full node, a regular node that can catchup from a full node, and a seed node. Individual nodes should be able to send transactions, get information about other transactions, register for consensus, and delegate their stake to other accounts who have registered. 

More info to come soon.
