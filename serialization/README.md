## Serialization Package
The serialization package supports the serialization of various data types for the Adamnite Protocol. The primary need is for the conversion of interfaces to bytes
and vice-versa. This package can be exported for use in the core blockchain, and for use when encoding various state operations. This package will also be expanded 
as time goes on for increased efficacy and the support of more data types. However, for POC Development, the base serialization operations converting interfaces to 
bytes should be more than enough.
