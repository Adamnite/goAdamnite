VRF Construction and use within the Adamnite Protocol (ie, how validators/witnesses will be selected for consensus):

-Every node that has declared that it wants to be a witness has a unique public-private key pair. We denote the private key as the secret key SK.

-Every 6 rounds (each round is 162 blocks), the top 10% of vote-getters are put in witness pool A, and a salt is added to a seed r. For the genesis block/round, r is without any salt.

-For each node in pool A, a weighted average M of the following 4 components is calculated: votes_recieved (25%), amount (25%), percentage of correct block produced (40%), and amount of times previously selected (10%).

-The following function is calculated for each node: VRF(SK, r) = N, where N is the result for the VRF calulation. 

-Each node then check if N is within the range (0,M). The first 26 validators to report success are selected to serve as witnesses for the round.
