# goAdamnite

goAdamnite is an implementation of the Adamnite Protocol in the GoLang programming language. The current plan is to include an implementation of DPOS, a P2P protocol that defines accounts and transactions, and setting up the overall project for POC_1.

Please look at all the branches if you are an interested contributor to determine where you want to best add value. This repo is open-sourced, and copryrighted under the GoAdamnite Authors, 2021.

Also, be sure to join the Contributor Discord if you are interested in contributing to the POC as a whole.




## Project Structure

A proposed project structure follows. The structure essentially outlines the various directories that will make up the proof of concept. Some of these directories 
have already been finalized for the POC stage, while others are stil in progress or have not been made yet. The core functionality of the Proof of Concept should depend on these directories, which should be formalized as packages.
